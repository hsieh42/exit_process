# Exit Process
As I proposed, I am working my best to make my transition and exit process as smooth as possible. I have listed items needed attention for each of the projects and needed to be transferred to each of the relevant members. And I will be working individually or as a subgroup with you. I promise I will make my stuff as easy as possible. If not, be tough on me on making things clearer. 

Thank you very much for your help during this transitional period.

## Timeline of the exit process
**Soft deadline**: 9/28/2018, the last date of my full-time employment.  I will be converted to a part-timer afterwards.

**Hard deadline**: until a replacement is hired and trained, perhaps 2-3 months after.

## How to use this portal
Please review the projects that I have worked now and before in the [Projects](https://github.com/hsieh42/exit_process/projects) tab on top. There are 12 projects created so far. You can have an overview of the projects and what needed to be done in the remaining days. You will see to-do items, assignments and issues opened/in-progress in each of the projects. 

You can create a new issue, questions, comments in the [Issues](https://github.com/hsieh42/exit_process/issues) tab on top so that we can track and work together to resolve. Be sure to properly assign the labels and project in the right panel when you create an issue. See [how-to](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests/).
